![Go Gopher Logo](/assets/logo.png)

---

**GoReadLater** is a minimalist bot written entirely in **pure Go (Golang)** — no external libraries used, only the **standard library**.  
It’s designed to be **modular, expandable**, and **messenger-agnostic**, so it’s easy to integrate with Telegram or any other platform.

---

## 📚 What does it do?

You find a cool message or link, but don't have time to read it right now? Just send it to the bot!  
Later, it will randomly remind you about the things you saved — like a helpful memory jogger 🧠.

> "Hey, you wanted to read this! Don’t forget 😉"
